# BOBCheats
##### BOB is a smart cheats system for unity games. The idea to create this plugin was one thing, to create a system that would make creating cheats for your game a pleasure. You can create cheats and use it in game by writing just one single method. 

## How do I cheat?
To start working with BOB, just follow a few simple steps.
1. Download and unpack latest release version of plugin (.unitypackage) from [**Here!**](https://github.com/wanakubwa/BOBCheats/releases)
2. Open BOBCheats settings from *window/BOBCheats* and click **Create BOBCheatManager**. Then it should spawn a GameObject in Your scene.
3. Now create a folder i.e. *Cheats* in your project (We will use it for storing game cheats).
4. Put a cheats container class inside folder from step **3**. Cheats container should be a class inherited from class `CheatsBase`.
